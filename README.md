**Author:** Julio Salinas  
**Date Created:** May 20, 2025

##  Overview

This project is a driver-based financial forecast of Microsoft’s income statement from FY2025 through FY2027, using historical data sourced from Microsoft’s 10-K filings from the period 2022-2024. The model includes revenue by business segment, separates SG&A from non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization tax logic, and projected margin performance. It's structured in the style of how strategic finance thinking used at a Series B startup like Base Power.

## Strategic Relevance

This model was built to mirror how FP&A and Strategic Finance teams at growth-stage companies approach forecasting:
- Cost structure clarity (cash vs. non-cash)

- Could be adapted to install-based scaling, such as the kind seen at Base Power
- Readiness for market expansion or pricing sensitivity analysis
